## Problems Faced, Decisions Made 

I was originally tasked with finding an image for the band website, I began by searching for images on Google Images, I was searching for an image that would clearly display band members and was large enough to be clearly displayed on the website.  The team later decided to AI-generate an image of each member for a more personalized image.  Once we had an image selected and approved by the rest of the team, we took the file and renamed it to something more memorable.  


To embed the image, we needed to recall the name of the file and use `<img src=>`


We then added an alt text to the image using `alt=`


## Self-Assessment 

Although I came into the project later than the rest of the team, I felt that I filled in on the tasks that were needed of me,  Such as image searching and description writing.


## Group Mmember Assessments

The rest of the team worked well together, and we had a good environment for sharing ideas on developing the site.
