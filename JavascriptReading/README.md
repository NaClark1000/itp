# Javascript Reading
1 "Values, Types, and Operators";
1.  I knew about the standard arithmetic javascript is able to do
2. I learned about other operators used to compare values logically such as as &&, ||, ??
2 "Program Structure"; and
1. I knew about some about conditional (if, else, and switch) and looping (while, do, and for) statements.
2. I learned how Bindings can be used to file pieces of data under a name, and how Jaaavascript uses those bindings to create an environment that  are useful for tracking state in your program.
