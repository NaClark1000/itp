# FizzBuzz

First added for loop that will increment by 1 for integers 1 to 100

`for (let count = 1; count <= 100; count++) {
	console.log(count);
  }`

Then added if statements for the numbers divisible by 3 and 5. 

`	if (count % 3 === 0){
		console.log("Fizz")
	}
	 if (count % 5 === 0) {
		 console.log("Buzz")}`

But this didnt replace the integer in the list just added "Fizz" or "Buzz" after it.
